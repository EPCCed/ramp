        <h1>Privacy Statement for the RAMP initiative </h1>

        <p>The information you provide will be used by EPCC and the Royal Society to co-ordinate responses like yours for the Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP) initiative. The information will be used to contact you about RAMP and to match your skills and offer for help with the needs of the community of academic experts in pandemic modelling that RAMP aims to aid.</p>  
        
        <p>We are using this information about you because it is necessary for our legitimate interests so we can achieve the goals of RAMP as described on <a href="https://epcced.github.io/ramp/">https://epcced.github.io/ramp/</a>  and to which goals you have subscribed by participating: in the survey embedded on the page between 28 March 2020 and 02 April 2020; and other similar surveys that we may conduct so as to record interest in RAMP participation.</p> 
        
        <p>Information about you will be shared with academic and UK Government research groups working on the COVID-19 pandemic modelling.</p> 
        
        <p>The information will be retained beyond the end of the survey so as to achieve these goals and for a period of up to 2 years from 01 April 2020. Any data held beyond this point will be anonymised.</p> 
        
        <p>If you want to withdraw from RAMP or if you have any questions, please contact us on <a href="mailto:covid19-ramp-support@jiscmail.ac.uk">covid19-ramp-support@jiscmail.ac.uk</a>.</p>
